# Image_toolbox
This is Dan's imaging toolbox package written in Python. The src/ folder contains:
    dumbtest.py # This is the most frequently updated file. Works like a main() function for testing other not well-developed files.   
    Cell_extract.py # This one utilizes skimage package to extract blobs (nuclei) from stacks of fluorescent images.
